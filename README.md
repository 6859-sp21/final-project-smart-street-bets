## Overview of development process

The work is split equally. Here are the lists of tasks that each member contributed to:

Eric: Data formatting, Graph Implementation, Functionalities on graph
Vic: Scrape articles and reddit posts, Calendar Implementation, Articles Implementation, Tooltip 

Work was mostly done independently through pushing code to either the main branch or a side branch and merged via a pull request. We had meetings at least twice a week to 1) catch up and update each other on one anotherâ€™s progress and 2) see if either one of us were having difficulty with a certain feature or had a bug they could not solve quickly. If this was the case, we both spent time looking at the code base to see if either one of us could spot the bug/figure out how to implement the feature together.
